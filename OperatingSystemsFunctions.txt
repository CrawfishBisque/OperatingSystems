Three Functions of an Operating System:

1: Booting
  Booting is the basic process of starting a computer. When the hardware is powered on, the inital Operating System kernel will be loaded
  into the computer's main memory, or RAM. Once this has been completed, the computer and OS are ready to run all applications and programs 
  indicated by the user. "Rebooting" an OS is the process of reloading the kernel without having to restart the computer's hardware.

2: Loading and Execution
  In an Operating System, the Loader is the program responsible for loading other programs and libraries to be run by the OS. An essential 
  stage in starting a program, the loader will move a program into system memory and prepare it for execution. The loader will read the 
  contents of the executable file which contains the program instructions, then resume any tasks needed to prepare the executale file for 
  running. Execution is the process in which a computer carries out the instructions coded into the loaded executable file. The terms "Run" 
  or "Execute" are used synonymously.
  
3: Data Security
  As essential to the Operating System as any hardware initialization or management program, Data Security is a crucial element function of 
  an OS. Ensuring the integrity, availability and privacy of all data contained within a computer is the main purpose of this function. 
  Many different techniques and methods can be implemented to achieve this, including data verification, specialized applications or 
  programs to detect malicious software or unauthorized users, or to ensure that all data packets contained within are whole and capable of 
  running safely within the system. Performing regular OS patch updates, screening incoming and outgoing network traffic through a 
  firewall, and maintaining secure accounts with required priviledges are all good ways to maintain a high level of security.
