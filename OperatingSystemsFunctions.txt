Three Functions of an Operating System:

1: Booting
  Booting is the basic process of starting a computer. When the hardware is powered on, the inital Operating System kernel will be loaded 
  into the computer's main memory, or RAM. Once this has been completed, the computer and OS are ready to run all applications and 
  programs indicated by the user. "Rebooting" an OS is the process of reloading the kernel without having to restart the computer's hardware.
